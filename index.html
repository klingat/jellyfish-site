    <td>It seems to go without saying that the most poisonous, deadliest and meanest of all the jellyfish inhabits Australia. The variety of box jellyfish known as the sea wasp or marine stinger is widely regarded as one of the most deadly creatures on earth. Along with other box jellies they have been responsible for at least 5,568 deaths recorded since 1954. The Australian variety causes around 1 death a year on average with a further 100 in South East Asia.
    <br>
    <br>
    As with so many of the deadliest animals it is said that from certain angles there are skull-like marking – in this case on the largely transparent bell. The 15 tentacles can reach up to 3 metres (10 ft) long and each is covered in around half a million venom infused, microscopic darts. It is estimated that each animal contains enough venom to kill 60 adult humans. The venom acts fast too and it can kill within minutes causing cardiovascular collapse. It also attacks the nervous system and skin cells.
    <br>
    <br>
    The actual sting has been compared to being branded with a red hot iron. It is said that the pain can be so severe that it may result in shock leading to drowning or heart failure on its own. Whilst stings are often survived pain can continue for weeks and there may be permanent scarring resembling whip marks across affected areas.

    With 24 eyes, four brains and an impressive 60 anal regions (whatever they are) the box jelly fish are definitely an advanced and formidable creature.</td>

    <td>What the Irukandji jellyfish lacks in size it makes up for in the power of its venom. The name is derived from the Irukandji people of North Australia, as this is where the jellyfish was first observed. However, it appears to be much more widespread than this with specimens allegedly found as far away as the British Isles.
    <br>
    <br>
    Measuring only 5mm (0.2 ins) across and with tentacles less than 1 metre (3 ft) it is one of the smallest members of the box jellyfish family. The venom though is insanely powerful; it is reputedly the most venomous animal toxin on earth, over 100 times more powerful than that of the cobra. In addition to this the Irukandji Jellyfish is unique in having stingers on its bell as well as tentacles.
    <br><br>
    The only reason this critter isn’t at the top of the list is its small size. Despite this the sting is without doubt potentially lethal. Often one sting will not kill as long as appropriate treatment is given. In non fatal stings Irukandji syndrome may develop with delightful symptoms such as excruciating muscle cramps, severe pain in the back and kidneys, burning sensation of the skin and face, vomiting, headache and increased heart rate. Victims have also described a ” feeling of impending doom”. The good news is that apparently, the sting itself isn’t too painful!</td>

The name comes from the air filled bladder that acts as a float and sail – this was thought reminiscent of the 17th century naval ships called men-of-war. I think the Portuguese bit also comes from the ship – I lived in Portugal for a while and never saw any of these critters.
    <br><br>
    In Australia they call it a blue-bottle because it’s blue.
    <br><br>
    The Man o’ War is found throughout the oceans of the world and has been sighted as far north as Scotland, thanks largely to the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
    <br><br>
    The sting of the Portuguese Man o’ War is both serious and common with up to 10,000 stings per annum in Australia alone. The sting itself is characterised by a painful raised whip-like welt across the skin. These can last from an hour to several days. The main risk is from systemic effects of the venom. In severe cases intense pain followed by fever, shock, and impaired heart and lung function leading to possible death may occur.</td>

    <br><br>
    The sea nettles are large jellyfish reaching up to 1ft (30cm) across. They have 24 tentacles which can measure well over 6ft (2m) in length and it is on these that the infamous stingers reside.
    The sting from a sea nettle can be extremely painful and leave a painful rash on the skin for around an hour. They are not generally dangerous though and medical assistance is very rarely needed. Reports of stings from more exotic Chrysaora species have been more serious.</td>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Some jellyfish can glow in the dark</h2>

        Many jellyfish have bioluminescent organs, which emit light. This light may help them in a number of different ways, like attracting prey or distracting predators.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish can clone themselves</h2>

        If a jellyfish is cut in two, the pieces of the jellyfish can regenerate and create two new organisms. Similarly, if a jellyfish is injured, it may clone itself and potentially produce hundreds of offspring.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Some jellyfish are immortal</h2>

        There are two phases to jelly life: the stationary polyp stage and the mobile medusa phase. It's the medusa phase that we're usually referring to when we talk about jellyfish. Typically, jellies start as polyps and develop into medusas, but the Turritopsis nutricula has earned it the nickname "the immortal jellyfish" for having the ability to travel backward to the polyp stage in times of stress.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish can teach us about efficient underwater propulsion</h2>

        The movements of bell-shaped jellyfish have provided researchers with a new understanding of propulsion. The flexibility of their umbrella-like bodies allow them to pulse upwards and downwards without expending much energy. Researchers have created biomimetic robots with flexible bells, which may one day lead to better undersea vehicles.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish don't have brains</h2>

        Instead, jellyfish have nerve nets which sense changes in the environment and coordinate the animal's responses.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish are surprisingly good at shutting down nuclear reactors</h2>

        In the past decade, jellyfish blooms have been responsible for shutting down several nuclear reactors, which often rely on ocean water intakes. The jellyfish swarms can clog the intake pipes, forcing facilities to stop operating temporarily.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish will eat peanut butter</h2>

        Peanut butter jellyfish! Need I say more?
        Ok, I will: two Aquarists in Dallas, Texas created a saltwater/peanut butter mix and fed it to moon jellies. Apparently, the jellies found this mix to be an acceptable source of protein. "We would love to claim we conducted this trial with noble purpose, but the truth is that we just wanted to make peanut butter and jellyfish simply to see if it could be done," the researchers write.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>Jellyfish might take over the ocean</h2>

        You may have heard that jellyfish are taking over the world's oceans. However, there's actually a good deal of debate about this issue among scientists.

        Still want to know more? I recommend JellyBiologist, the excellent blog by researcher Rebecca Helm.</li>
